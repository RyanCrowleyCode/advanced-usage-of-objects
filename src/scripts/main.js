// Practice: Car Sales
// Randall has come back with a new job for you. Each week, he wants to see a report of how many cars each salesperson sells for that week. 

// Here's your first data structure for the sales made last week. You will need to start off by iterating the array of sales with a forEach() method. Then iterate the entries of the vehicle property of each sale.

import salesByWeek from "./data.js"
